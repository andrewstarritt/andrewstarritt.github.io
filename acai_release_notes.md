## <a name="v1.5"></a><span style='color:#0066ee'>1.5</span>

The introduction of the 1.5 series was due to a change in the behavour of
the putString function.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.8</span>

Released: 27-08-2020

Added the following function to acai client.

     bool putByteArray (void* valueArray, const unsigned int count);

This writes a traditional byte array value to the channel.
Under the covers, this uses the DBF_CHAR field type.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.7</span>

Released: 04-07-2020

Improved acai_monitor option processing and help message.

Made acai_private_common.h public for test_csnprintf and added suitable use at
your own peril warning - it is __*still*__ essentially private.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.6</span>

There __was no__ 1.5.6 release - I incremented the version no. twice by mistake.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.5</span>

Update to support MSVC, specifically define  snprintf  as \_snprintf for
Released: 14-01-2020

MSVC versions eariler than 1900. Also updated code to eliminate some MSVC
warnings.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.4</span>

Released: 24-08-2019

Added the following function to acai client:

      static ACAI::Client* cast (void* item);

This function attempts to cast a void* to a Client* and checks the internal
magic numbers.
It returns NULL if cast fails, similar to dynamic_cast.

The client hostname isnow inclued in acai_monitor meta data output.

Fixed the fuction *[sic]* typo.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.3</span>

Released: 22-07-2019

Updated to keep MSVC happy, including:
 * Avoid constructor ambiguity - now use overloading as opposed to using
 default parameters - no user code change required;
 * Don't use dynamically sized stack variables;
 * Use size_t type variables where appropriate; and
 * Update code to remove warnings.

Now include stdlib.h for malloc/free when using mingw.

Updated the configure/RELEASE file to match latest generated by  makeBaseApp.pl
(out of base-7.0.2)

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.2</span>

Released: 29-04-2019

Modified the in logic in putString.
For PVs with a DBF type of DBF_CHAR, the PV must have two or more elements
in order to be deemed a long string.
A single DBF_CHAR (like the .PROC field) are not deemed a long string.

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.5.1</span>

Released: 30-03-2019

Modified the behavior of putString.
This will now always write the string data in long string format if the native
type if DBF_CHAR irrespective of the isLongString setting and/or PV name ending
with a '$'.
The isLongString setting now just applies to getString.

## <a name="v1.4"></a><span style='color:#0066ee'>1.4</span>

The introduction of the 1.4 series was due to re-factoring the acai version
macros into a separate acai_version.h file

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.4.8</span>

Released: 20-03-2019

Removed another not very help error report (when element count = 0, out
of the readSubscribeChannel function).

### <span style='color:#00aa88'>1.4.7</span>

Released: 18-03-2019

Don't report errors for zero length updates, these seem to be quite common
for transient PVs.

acai_monitor - tidied up info output and added copyright header to main file.

Fixed a few typos in the  README.md file and updated email address.

Ran doxygen -u over acai.cfg - mainly comment changes.
